    <h2>Swaminarayan Gurukul</h2>
    <p>The Shree Swaminarayan Gurukul was founded in 1948 by Sadguru Shastriji Maharaj Shri Dharmajivandasji Swami in Rajkot, Gujarat, India. The inspiration for the Gurukul came from Shastriji Maharaj's pilgrimage to Badrinath, where he felt a calling to preserve and propagate the teachings of Bhagwan Shree Swaminarayan. The Gurukul started with seven students in a rented house and has since grown into a large educational institution with multiple campuses across India and beyond. <br>
